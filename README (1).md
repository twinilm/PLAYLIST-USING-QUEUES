**Playlist Using Queues**
**Overview**
This project is a simple web-based application that demonstrates how a Queue data structure can be applied to a real-life scenario: managing a music playlist.
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the system allows users to add songs, play them in order, and clear or update the playlist. All playlist operations follow the FIFO (First-In First-Out) principle.

**Purpose**
The project is designed to help learners understand how a queue works in practice by integrating it into a functional and familiar application. It is ideal for data structures demonstrations and academic mini-projects.

**Features**
1. Add songs to the playlist (enqueue)
2.Play or remove the next song (dequeue)

**View the full playlist in order**

1.Remove specific songs
2.Clear the entire playlist
3.Simple, responsive browser-based interface

**Why Use a Queue?**
A playlist naturally follows FIFO behavior—songs should play in the order they were added.
Queue operations map directly to playlist functions:
Enqueue → Add song
Dequeue → Play next song
This project helps visualize the queue’s behavior clearly through UI interaction.

**Tech Stack**
1.HTML
2.CSS
3.JavaScript
No backend or external libraries are required. The project runs entirely in the browser.

**How to Run**
Clone or download the repository.
Open index.html in any modern web browser.
